Hi, I'm Jenn! I'm currently a 4th year undergrad studying Computer Science and Mathematics in the [Turing Scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars) and [Polymathic Scholars](https://honors.cns.utexas.edu/polymathic-scholars) honors programs and minoring in African and African Diaspora Studies, Sociology, and Women and Gender Studies at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).
I'm lucky to be advised by [Dr. Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Dr. Kevin Tian](https://kjtian.github.io/), and I've had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Sina Fazelpour](https://sinafazelpour.com/). 

With Dr. Maria De-Arteaga and Dr. Sina Fazelpour, I've worked on diversity and dataset development. With Dr. Kevin Tian, I've worked on "beyond-worst-case" distributionally robust optimization (DRO) focused on improving performance for marginalized intersectional groups in demographic-free settings. I've also been fortunate to have my Polymathic Scholars Honors Thesis advised by Dr. Maria De-Arteaga and [Dr. Tina Peterson](https://sites.google.com/view/tlpeterson).

My research interests lie in AI and algorithmic fairness and natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of developing systems that empower people without perpetuating societal harms.
