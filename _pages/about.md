Hi, I'm Jenn! I'm currently a 4th year undergrad studying Computer Science and Mathematics in the [Turing Scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars) and [Polymathic Scholars](https://honors.cns.utexas.edu/polymathic-scholars) honors programs and minoring in African and African Diaspora Studies, Sociology, and Women and Gender Studies at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).
I'm lucky to be advised by [Dr. Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Dr. Kevin Tian](https://kjtian.github.io/), and I've had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Sina Fazelpour](https://sinafazelpour.com/). 

With Dr. Maria De-Arteaga and Dr. Sina Fazelpour, I've worked on diversity and dataset development. With Dr. Kevin Tian, I've worked on improving distributional robust optimization (DRO) for marginalized intersectional groups. I've also been fortuante to have my Polymathic Scholars Honors Thesis advised by both Dr. Maria De-Arteaga and [Dr. Tina Peterson](https://sites.google.com/view/tlpeterson).

My research intersts lie in AI and algorithmic fairness and natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of developing systems that empower people and do not contribute to systems of oppression. If we share interests, feel free to reach out! :)
