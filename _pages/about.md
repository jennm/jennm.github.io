Hi, I'm Jenn! I'm a researcher studying the social impact of generative AI systems
<!-- social biases (both implicit and explicit) in AI systems  -->
and developing robust algorithms, [frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05949), and [evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00333) that support the development of systems that empower people without perpetuating societal harms. 

I finished my undergrad at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in 2024 where I was a [Dean's Honored Graduate](https://cns.utexas.edu/info-undergraduate-students/events-recognition/deans-honored-graduates) and studied Computer Science and Mathematics in the [Turing Scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars) and [Polymathic Scholars](https://honors.cns.utexas.edu/polymathic-scholars) honors programs and minored in African and African Diaspora Studies, Sociology, and Women and Gender Studies at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). Currently, I am a software engineer building evaluations on the LLM Observability team at Datadog and working on research with my wonderful thesis advisors [Dr. Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/), [Dr. Kevin Tian](https://kjtian.github.io/), and [Dr. Leqi Liu](https://leqiliu.github.io/).


<!-- As well as working with my wondeful collobarators! (roughly in reverse chronological order): [Trista Cao](https://tristaycao.github.io/), [Jonathan Li](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jli/), [Saloni Modi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saloni-modi42/), [Sina Fazelpour](https://sinafazelpour.com/).  -->
