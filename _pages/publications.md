My research interests lie in AI and algorithmic fairness, and natural language processing (NLP). The goal of my work, anchored in intersectionality and a multicultural interdisciplinary perspective, is to 

* **understand** the social impact of generative AI on users and society (such as understanding social biases and representation)
* **develop** robust algorithms, frameworks, and evaluations for addressing and understanding the social impact of generative AI in varying contexts

<!-- * **understand** existing societal impacts (such as societal biases (both implicit and explicit) within generative AI, how they present in downstream tasks, and how they affect users
* **develop** robust algorithms, frameworks, and evaluations to mitigate and address these biases within existing systems and in downstream tasks -->
