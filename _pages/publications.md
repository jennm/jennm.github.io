My research interests lie in AI and algorithmic fairness and natural language procssing (NLP). My work is anchored in intersectionality and a multicultural interdisciplinary goal. The goal of my work is to 
* understand existing societal biases within LLMs and multimodal models, how they present in downstream tasks, and how they affect users
* develop algorithms these biases within existing systems and in downstream tasks
