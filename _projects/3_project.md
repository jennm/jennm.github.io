For my [DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) Capstone](https://cns.utexas.edu/info-undergraduate-students/communities-experience/dei-concentration-council) project, I worked to tackle microaggressions in computer science by developing a welcoming environment. 
Below is the presentation I developed to present to the College of Natural Sciences leadership.
