As part of my final project for [CS 342, Neural Networks](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/courses/342-neural-networks) in Spring 2023, I investigated existing benchmarking datasets for understanding bias in language models. Below you can find my write-up for this project, and the code is located on [Github](https://github.com/jennm/intersectionaly-in-occupation-cs378-nlp).
